# dotfiles

This repo contains my configuration files for my dev / daily driver environment, which includes:
- `sway` as WM, with a tabbed layout, and `waybar` as control panel
- `nvim` config with some custom remaps
- `wofi` as application launcher
- `kitty` as terminal
- `dunst` as notification manager

My own `zshrc` and a bunch of custom aliases are also included.

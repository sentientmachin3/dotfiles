# dotfiles

This repo contains my configuration files for my dev / daily driver environment, which includes:

- `sway` as WM, with a tabbed layout, and `waybar` as control panel
- `kickoff` as application launcher
- `ghostty` as terminal
- `mako` as notification manager

## Installation

To install the files in the directory run `stow -t ~/ .`. This will symlink all files in the current directory into your home,
following the tree laid out in this directory.

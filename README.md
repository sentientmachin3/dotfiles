This repo contains my configuration files for my dev / daily driver environment, which includes:
- `sway` as WM, with a tabbed layout, and `waybar` as control panel
- `wofi` as application launcher
- `kitty` as terminal
- `dunst` as notification manager

## Neovim setup
Neovim is configured to behave similarly to VSCode. Just copy the nvim directory into the `.config` folder.
To make it work you just need to install the Lazy plugin manager and you are good to go.

The currently supported languages are typescript and lua, more will follow.

## Color themes
- tmux: [gruvbox](https://github.com/egel/tmux-gruvbox)
- neovim: [gruvbox-material](https://github.com/sainnhe/gruvbox-material)
- wayland and sway are custom
